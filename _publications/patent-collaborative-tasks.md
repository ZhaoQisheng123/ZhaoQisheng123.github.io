## Abstract

This patent describes a shortest time decision method and system for cluster collaborative tasks based on formal methods. The approach optimizes task completion time while ensuring formal correctness guarantees through temporal logic specifications and verification techniques.

## Key Features

- **Time Optimization**: Minimization of task completion time in cluster systems
- **Formal Verification**: Guaranteed correctness through formal methods
- **Collaborative Planning**: Multi-agent coordination for optimal task execution
- **Constraint Handling**: Management of temporal and resource constraints

## Applications

- Industrial automation systems
- Multi-robot manufacturing
- Cluster computing task scheduling
- Collaborative robotics applications
