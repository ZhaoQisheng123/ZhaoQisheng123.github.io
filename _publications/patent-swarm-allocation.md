## Abstract

This patent presents a dynamic allocation decision method and system for unmanned swarm operations based on formal methods. The approach utilizes temporal logic and formal verification techniques to ensure reliable and efficient task allocation in swarm robotics systems.

## Key Features

- **Formal Methods Integration**: Use of temporal logic for task specification and verification
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Real-time task allocation based on swarm capabilities and constraints
- **Swarm Coordination**: Coordinated decision-making across unmanned swarm systems
- **Verification Guarantees**: Formal verification of allocation decisions and system behavior

## Applications

- Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms
- Autonomous ground vehicle coordination
- Multi-agent system task allocation
- Swarm intelligence applications
