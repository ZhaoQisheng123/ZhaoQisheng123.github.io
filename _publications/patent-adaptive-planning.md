## Abstract

This patent describes an adaptive planning method for multi-robot systems that incorporates uncertainty perception capabilities for dynamic task environments. The method enables robots to adapt their planning strategies based on real-time uncertainty assessment and environmental changes.

## Key Features

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Real-time assessment of environmental and task uncertainties
- **Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic adjustment of planning strategies based on uncertainty levels
- **Multi-robot Coordination**: Coordinated planning across multiple robots with uncertainty awareness
- **Robust Performance**: Enhanced reliability in dynamic and uncertain environments

## Applications

- Autonomous exploration and mapping
- Multi-robot task allocation
- Dynamic environment navigation
- Collaborative robotics systems
