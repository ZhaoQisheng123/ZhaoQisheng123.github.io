👋 About Me
======
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University (2023-present), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhongkui Li (李忠奎)](https://www.zhongkuili-pku.com/cn/), and collaborating closely with [Prof. Meng Guo (国萌)](https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/index.html). 
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the CDHAW at Tongji University.


My research focuses on **multi-robot coordination, task decision-making, and motion planning in dynamic and unknown environments**. I am also deeply interested in robotic mobile manipulation.

🤖**Long-term Goal:**  I hope to contribute to the advancement of robotics by exploring cutting-edge algorithms while helping robots become practical products that can enter thousands of households.
