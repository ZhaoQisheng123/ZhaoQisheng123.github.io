👋 About Me
======
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University (2023-present), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhongkui Li (李忠奎)](https://www.zhongkuili-pku.com/cn/), and collaborating closely with [Prof. Meng Guo (国萌)](https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/index.html). 
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the CDHAW at Tongji University.


My research focuses on **multi-robot coordination, task decision-making, and motion planning in dynamic and unknown environments**. I am particularly interested in **robotic mobile manipulation under long-horizon sequential tasks**, where robots must perform complex manipulation operations while navigating through dynamic environments over extended time periods.

🤖**Long-term Goal:**  I hope to contribute to the advancement of robotics by developing robust algorithms for long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, enabling robots to perform complex sequential operations in real-world environments. My vision is to bridge the gap between theoretical multi-robot coordination and practical household robotics applications, ultimately helping robots become reliable assistants that can seamlessly integrate into daily life.
